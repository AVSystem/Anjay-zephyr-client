# This is file (F) by notation used in doc above.

# Because we need to set some board-dependent variables in MCUBoot child image,
# (F) file was created. (F) requires (H) to exist, and (H) completely replaces (B),
# thus (H) was created by copying (B) file. Keep in mind, that if a (D) file exists
# for some board, the (F) file should also be based on (D).
